                Been programming in C++ and python for 4+ years now and have
                experience in many areas of programming. I can work with
                APIs, do machine learning anaylisis and create very robust 
                testing algorithms.
                
                My work has been primarily done in the stock market. Which 
                entails, gathering data from an API, possibly cleaning the 
                data, Writing an algorithm to gain some sort of knowledge 
                about the data, and then finally testing the conclusion that
                was made from the anaylisis using machine learning with python 
                or a full backtest using C++. These projects require a lot of 
                developing and testing to get it right.
                
                My interests include financial markets and using machine learning
                to optimize business strategies. I am looking for a company that 
                will allow me to use my combined skills of financial markets and 
                computer science to achieve your goals.

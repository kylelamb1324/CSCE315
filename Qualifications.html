            Been programming in C++ and python for 4+ years now and have 
            experience in many areas of programming. I can work with
            APIs, do machine learning anaylisis and create very robust 
            testing algorithms.

            My work has been primarily done in the stock market. Which 
            entails, gathering data from an API, possibly cleaning the 
            data, Writing an algorithm to gain some sort of knowledge 
            about the data, and then finally testing the conclusion that
            was made from the anaylisis using machine learning with python 
            or a full backtest using C++. These projects require a lot of 
            developing and testing to get it right.

            My interests include financial markets and using machine learning
            to optimize business strategies. I am looking for a company that 
            will allow me to use my combined skills of financial markets and 
            computer science to achieve your goals.

            My name is Kyle Lamb I am currently A third year computer engineering student
            at Texas A&M planning to graduate in 2022. I was born in Bryan Texas in 1999 
            and was raised there my whole life. I love to play the piano because its an art that
            challenges my creativity, it is a great escape when I am working on a large project.
            I am also one of those people who can't sit in front of a computer for hours on 
            end, which might sound strange because I am a programmer. But what I quickly found
            out is that I need something to reset my mind when working on my projects. I found
            power lifting to be an amazing hobby of mine and it really helps me reset my mind 
            when I am struggling, I have been power lifting for multiple years now.
            
            I have a passion for data science, and plan to use this knowledge to start a company
            in the financial world. I am fascinated with computer science and am eager to learn 
            new ways to develop technology.

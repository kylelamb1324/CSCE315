            Currently in school at Texas A&M university for computer engineering <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>
            working on receiving my bachelors.

            Im currently working on many projects inside the stock market. Ive developed
            my own backtesting library in c++ that utilizes multiple threads. I have done
            a lot of work  gathering statistics about the stock market for example, how likely
            is the market to move up or down at any given day, how much does it move up or down,
            and other statistics like how different company statistics affects the price
            movements (earnings, debt, PE ratios, ROI) 
        </p>
        <p class style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            I have also had the chance to create my own trading bot using the <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/basis">MQL4</a> language.
            This has been a great experience, and it really tested my skills because there isnt
            many people who know how to program in this language so it allowed me to adapt
            and learn without a mentor.

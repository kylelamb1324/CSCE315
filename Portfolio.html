            I am currently in school at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a> university studying computer engineering 
            working on receiving my bachelors, after receiving my bachelors im looking to get into the
            masters program at Texas A&M university.
        </p>

        <p class style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            I have extensive experiance working with APIs, machine learning, AI, multi threaded programing,
            and automation. Im currently working on many projects inside the stock market. Ive developed
            my own backtesting library in <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">c++</a> that utilizes multi threaded programs.
            I have done a lot of work gathering statistics about the stock market for example, how likely
            is the market to move up or down at any given day, how much does it move up or down,
            and other statistics like how different company statistics affects the price
            movements (earnings, debt, PE ratios, ROI). I have experiance working with APIs as well,
            the work I have done requires a lot of data and API calls are essential such as Quantopian
            or AlphaVantage I have automated programs on my computer to make work more efficiant
            and would love to do this work on a large scale to optimize company performance.

            I have also had the chance to create my own trading bot using the <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/basis">MQL4</a> language.
            This has been a great experience, and it really tested my skills because there isnt
            many people who know how to program in this language so it allowed me to adapt
            and learn without a mentor. This language is most similiar to c, but it really has
            helped me adapt to difficult situations and has helped me get better at reading documentation.
            I am very flexible and can adapt to whatever work you need to solve your problems.
        </p>

            Here is some documentation on <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">machine learning</a> that I have done.
            Here is some documentation on <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/">AlphaVantage</a>, a fiance and stock market API.

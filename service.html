                One of my biggest goals is to achieve excellence and once I achieve this I want to give 
                back to the community that gave it to me. I am currently a part of a programming group,
                we communicate through telegram about stock trading/programming. It is a great experience
                to be a part of because it is made up from people all around the world and everyone is very
                humble and will help out those who are in need. I remember when I first started programming
                for the purpose of financial markets, I had a lot of questions and the guys in the group
                were so helpful to me get the ball rolling. Now im able to give back to those who were in my shoes.
               
                I have extensive plans to combine programming and financial markets to provide people with
                products and services to aid them in there financial careers. But first the challenge is 
                to master the science and come up with ways to help people. I aspire to learn more and from 
                this help those who are in need.
